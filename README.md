Mastr Cntrl is the [indieweb](https://indieweb.org) server for [this blog](https://vincentp.me).

## Purpose

Content is routed via this server (hosted on Heroku). Anything POST'ed and accepted to the server is POST'ed to the Github API.

This triggers a webhook that tells [Netlify](https://netlify.com) to rebuild the [Jekyll site](http://jekyllrb.com) static site.

POST'ed content also triggers a webhook informing Mastr Cntrl to syndicate/post/update content to 3rd party providers.

Currently webmentions are updated from [Webmention.io](https://webmention.io) on a nightly basis, via a Zapier zap. In future Mastr Cntrl will manage this.

## Dependencies

- This service uses Redis for cache management with Redis to go add-on
- Heroku is used to host this.
